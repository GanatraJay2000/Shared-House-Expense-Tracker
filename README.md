# Shared House Expense Tracker

## Overview

As a recent graduate facing the challenges of shared living arrangements, I encountered difficulties in managing shared expenses among my roommates. To address this problem and to simultaneously explore the latest technologies, I am embarking on creating the Shared House Expense Tracker. This project serves as a project where I aim to leverage cutting-edge technology to streamline expense management while also gaining hands-on experience with new technologies.

The Shared House Expense Tracker is a web/mobile application designed to simplify and manage shared expenses among residents of a shared house or apartment. This tool helps users track expenses, split bills based on customizable criteria, and maintain fair financial balances within the household.
